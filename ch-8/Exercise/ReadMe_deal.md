# Dealing a hand of cards
This program requires random numbers generator,using libraries for rand(), srand() and time function time() we can generate random number
later on divide it by modulo of the number n to get a range of n-1, and we can off set it by adding or subtracting c(constant)
Thats a random number generator.

Later we use 2D array and Constant array, 

Its the perfect example for demonstrating all this into one program!
